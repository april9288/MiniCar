# Mini Car

It's a 3d truck-like model built with Three.js library. Three.js is a Javascript library for rendering 3d models in web browsers. This project is not complete yet. Only 90% done. But now I'm now working hard on making a wing to attach to the truck. So it will end up looking like a flying truck which I have imagined only in my head.

Two files are really essential here.

* js/OrbitControl.js - it allows the camera to orbit around a target.

## Built With

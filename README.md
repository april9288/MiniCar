# Mini Car

Hi. I'm James Jongho Kim. I made a 3d model which is a truck. It's not complete yet. I'm making a wing to attach to the truck. So it will end up looking like a flying truck which I have imagine only in my head.

Two files are really essential here.

* js/OrbitControl.js - it allows the camera to orbit around a target.

## Built With
